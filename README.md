## About the Project

The **"Loopstudios Landing Page"** is a Frontend Mentor challenge designed to showcase a creative agency's portfolio.

This project was developed using **React**, initialized with `create-react-app`, providing a component-based structure that simplifies the management of the landing page's various sections.

**CSS** was used for basic styling, while **Scss** took over for the styling of the rest of the components, offering a more sophisticated approach to design with its advanced features.
